## Next Steps

Each phase builds upon the previous one, so we'll work through them sequentially. However, we can adjust the pace and focus areas based on your interests and learning style.

The practical projects are designed to be:
- **Hands-on**: You'll write real code and build working systems
- **Progressive**: Each project increases in complexity
- **Relevant**: Projects solve real-world problems you might encounter
- **Flexible**: We can adapt projects based on your specific interests
