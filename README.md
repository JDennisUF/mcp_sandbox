# MCP Learning Game Plan

This repository contains a series of MCP servers developed as part of a learning game plan to master the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The project is divided into phases, each focusing on a different aspect of MCP.

## Phases

*   **Phase 1: MCP Fundamentals & Setup:** A basic "Hello World" server to understand the fundamentals of MCP.
*   **Phase 2: Tools Deep Dive:** A more advanced server with a variety of tools, focusing on tool creation, parameter validation, and error handling.
*   **Phase 3: Resources Mastery:** (In Progress) This phase will focus on understanding and implementing MCP resources.
*   **Phase 4: Prompts and Templates:** This phase will cover designing and implementing effective prompt templates and libraries.
- **Phase 5: Advanced Integration Patterns:** This phase will cover building complex multi-server architectures and plugin systems.
- **Phase 6: Real-World Applications:** This phase will focus on building production-ready MCP servers with security, deployment, and monitoring.

## Running the Servers

Each phase has its own server located in a corresponding `phaseX-<name>` directory. To run a server, navigate to its directory and use the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Run the server
npm start
```

## GEMINI.md

This project includes a `GEMINI.md` file that serves as a guide for the Gemini agent. It outlines the project's goals, structure, and available tools, ensuring that the agent can assist effectively in the development process.
